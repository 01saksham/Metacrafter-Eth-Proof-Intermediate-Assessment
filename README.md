#Error Handling In Solidity (Module-1)
The contract includes a function called "checkThreshold" that takes two unsigned integer parameters, "number" and "threshold", and returns a boolean value indicating if the number is greater than the threshold.

The error handling process in the "checkThreshold" function is as follows:

The "require" statement is used to validate if the threshold is greater than zero. If the threshold is not greater than zero, the execution is immediately stopped, and an exception is thrown with the error message "Threshold must be greater than zero". This ensures that the threshold value is valid and prevents the function from proceeding with incorrect inputs.

If the threshold condition is met, the code checks if the number is greater than the threshold using an "if" statement. If the number is greater, it returns "true", indicating that the number is indeed greater than the threshold.

In case the number is not greater, the code checks if the number is equal to the threshold using an "else if" statement. If they are equal, the "revert" statement is triggered, causing the transaction to be reverted, and an error message "Number is equal to the threshold" is displayed. This ensures that the number is distinct from the threshold value.

Lastly, if none of the above conditions are met, it means that the number is less than the threshold. In this case, the "assert" statement is used to verify this condition. If the assertion fails, indicating a logical error in the code, the execution is halted. This provides an additional level of error checking and ensures that the contract's logic is upheld.

The "checkThreshold" function demonstrates how require, assert, and revert statements can be used to handle different scenarios and ensure the validity of inputs and contract execution.

##Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
1.Solidity compiler version 0.8.7 or compatible
2.Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat, etc.)

##Deployment:
1.To deploy the "GreaterThanCheck" contract on the Ethereum network, follow these steps:

2.Compile the Solidity code using a Solidity compiler.

3.Choose your preferred deployment method (Remix, Truffle, etc.) and provide the necessary configuration details such as the network and gas limit.

4.Deploy the contract to the desired Ethereum network using your chosen deployment method.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the "checkThreshold" function with appropriate parameters to check if a number is greater than a threshold.
